GoChat is a real-time chat application built with Go for the backend and React for the frontend. It uses WebSockets for real-time communication between clients and the server.

## Quick Start

### Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/aayushxrj/gochat
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory

```
cd ./gochat/
```

Now you can get the app up and running using either [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or by running it locally.

### Local Usage

To get started with GoChat, you need to have Go and Node.js installed on your machine. Go is used for running the backend server, and Node.js is used for managing frontend dependencies and running the development server.

1. Install Prerequisites

- Go (1.22.2 or later)
- Node.js (19.8.1 or later)

2. Start the backend server

```
cd src/backend/
```
```
go run .
```

3. Start the frontend development server
   
  Open a new terminal session and run:

```
npm install
```
```
npm run dev
```

You can access the app at `http://localhost:5173/`

### Docker Usage (coming soon)

If you have Docker installed and running, you can also run the application using Docker. Follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image locally:

```

```
or directly pull from Docker Hub (recommended):
